## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| WYSIWYG editor | Markdown is source of truth; editing creates sync issues |
| CMS backend | Git is the CMS — leverage existing workflows |
| Real-time collaboration | Requires server infrastructure; static is sufficient |
| Component playground | This is documentation, not Storybook |
| Multi-repo aggregation | Keep it simple — one `.planning` folder per site |
| Plugin marketplace | Premature abstraction; start opinionated |
| Authentication | Deploy behind reverse proxy if needed |
| Custom themes | Ships with one look; customization later |
| i18n/multi-language | No evidence GSD users need this |
