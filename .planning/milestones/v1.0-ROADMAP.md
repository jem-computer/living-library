# Milestone v1.0: Initial Release

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-25
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 13

## Overview

This roadmap delivers a zero-config documentation site generator for GSD `.planning` folders. The journey moves from CLI foundation (making `npx living-library` work anywhere) through content parsing and navigation (reading and displaying GSD structure) to theming and search (table stakes for 2026 documentation tools), finishing with production builds and GSD-specific enhancements that differentiate from generic doc generators.

## Phases

### Phase 1: CLI Foundation & Dev Server

**Goal**: User can run `npx living-library` in any directory and see a working dev server
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: CLI-01, CLI-02, CONT-04
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Package setup and entry points
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Terminal UI and dev server modules
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — CLI wiring and end-to-end verification

**Success Criteria** (verified):
1. ✓ User runs `npx living-library` and dev server starts within 5 seconds
2. ✓ Dev server auto-detects `.planning` folder even in monorepo subdirectories
3. ✓ Server displays clear startup message with exact URL and version number
4. ✓ Server auto-selects free port if 4321 is taken
5. ✓ File changes in `.planning/*.md` trigger live reload without full refresh

**Completed:** 2026-01-24

### Phase 2: Content & Navigation

**Goal**: User sees their `.planning` docs as a navigable documentation site
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: CONT-01, CONT-02, CONT-03, NAV-01, NAV-02, NAV-03, NAV-04, GSD-01, GSD-02, GSD-03
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Content collection and navigation tree builder
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Layout components and global styles
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Page routing and content rendering
- [x] 02-04-PLAN.md — Sidebar interactivity and mobile menu

**Success Criteria** (verified):
1. ✓ All `.md` files in `.planning` render as HTML with working links and images
2. ✓ Code blocks have syntax highlighting for common languages (js, ts, py, md)
3. ✓ Left sidebar shows folder structure as collapsible tree matching `.planning` layout
4. ✓ GSD structure folders (phases/, milestones/, research/) appear grouped and labeled
5. ✓ Current page is highlighted in sidebar and scrolls into view
6. ✓ On mobile, sidebars collapse to hamburger menu
7. ✓ Right sidebar shows table of contents from current page headings (H2/H3)

**Completed:** 2026-01-25

### Phase 3: Theming & Search

**Goal**: Users can search docs and switch between light/dark themes
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: THEME-01, THEME-02, THEME-03, SRCH-01, SRCH-02, SRCH-03
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Theme CSS variables and Shiki dual themes
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Search integration with astro-pagefind
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — Layout wiring (theme toggle, search, content marking)

**Success Criteria** (verified):
1. ✓ Site defaults to light theme with clean, GitBook-style aesthetic
2. ✓ Dark theme toggle in header switches entire site to dark mode
3. ✓ Site respects user's system color scheme preference on first load
4. ✓ Search box in header accepts queries and shows live results
5. ✓ Search results display file name and context snippet highlighting matches
6. ✓ Search index is built at compile time and loads quickly on first search

**Completed:** 2026-01-25

### Phase 4: Static Build & GSD Features

**Goal**: Users can deploy production sites and see GSD-specific enhancements
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: CLI-03, CLI-04, GSD-04
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Build command infrastructure (CLI subcommand, build.js module)
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Root docs prominence and STATE.md filtering
- [x] 04-03-PLAN.md — Milestone timeline page and navigation integration

**Success Criteria** (verified):
1. ✓ User runs `npx living-library build` and static site outputs to `./dist`
2. ✓ Build output is deployment-ready HTML/CSS/JS with no server dependencies
3. ✓ Milestone timeline page shows completed vs active milestones chronologically
4. ✓ Root documentation files (PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, REQUIREMENTS.md) appear prominently in navigation

**Completed:** 2026-01-25

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Astro for site generation — User preference, good DX, fast builds (✓ Good)
- npx + installable — Supports both quick preview and CI builds (✓ Good)
- Light theme + dark toggle — Shipped both instead of light-only (✓ Good)
- Sidebar navigation for v1 — Standard pattern works well (✓ Good)
- Pagefind for search — Compile-time indexing, no server needed (✓ Good)
- Native parseArgs — No external dependencies for CLI (✓ Good)
- Content collection with glob loader — Flexible markdown handling (✓ Good)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Port conflicts resolved with get-port automatic fallback
- Monorepo detection with find-up directory walking
- FOUC prevention with inline theme init script
- Case sensitivity in content collection IDs (fixed during Phase 4)

**Issues Deferred:**
- Package-relative content collection paths (works for dogfooding, needs adjustment for npm publish)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None — clean implementation
